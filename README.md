# A simple parallax with DragonRuby

So this is my first try at DragonRuby. I tried to make a parallax, which 
I already did for a game with CSFML.

*Sorry for the recording quality. The parallax looks way better than that.*

## Credits

Images were found randomly on the web, they were free to use but I think 
they need to be in the credits.
